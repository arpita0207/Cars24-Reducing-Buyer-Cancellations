# Cars24-Reducing-Buyer-Cancellations

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and addressing Cars24’s high post-booking buyer cancellation rate (~28%, McKinsey 2023), which creates inefficiencies in unit economics, inventory management, and customer trust within the used-car resale ecosystem.  
The outcome is a detailed Product Requirement Document (PRD) proposing solutions to reduce cancellations and strengthen Cars24’s competitive position.

##  Objectives
- Reduce high post-booking buyer cancellations that impact unit economics and inventory risk.  
- Improve buyer trust, seller confidence, and dealer predictability in the Cars24 marketplace.  
- Strengthen Cars24’s differentiation against competitors like Spinny and OLX Autos.  

---

##  Approach
- **Research & Validation**: Market study, user persona mapping (buyers, sellers, dealers), and competitor benchmarking.  
- **Problem Identification**: Price transparency gaps, low switching costs, and weak buyer commitment mechanisms.  
- **Solution Design**: Proposed a **Smart Commitment Layer** with:
  - Tiered refundable booking fees  
  - Price-match guarantee  
  - Instant buyer rewards  
- **PRD Development**: Detailed success metrics, risk mitigation strategies, and rollout roadmap (A/B pilots, phased scaling).

##  Key Features
1. **Tiered Refundable Booking Fee** – discourages casual cancellations by adding “skin in the game.”  
2. **Price-Match Guarantee** – neutralizes competitor-driven cancellations.  
3. **Instant Buyer Rewards** – creates early psychological lock-in through tangible benefits (free RC transfer, insurance discounts, accessory coupons).

##  Expected Impact
- 40% reduction in cancellations within 6 months.  
- +25% uplift in booking-to-purchase conversion rates.  
- 12–18% savings in operational costs from reduced reversals.  
- +10 point NPS improvement within 6 months.  
- +20% repeat buyer growth within 12 months.
